intro: |
  Writing high quality CSS is not easy. And not because CSS is a complicated language (it's not easy either), but due the lack of something other languages have: **a registry of reusable packages**. While JavaScript has NPM, PHP has Packagist, Rust has Crates, or Python has PyPI, in CSS you have to copy and paste code from blog posts, Stack Overflow, or keep your collection of snippets.

  You can use a CSS framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap, but if you want to do something unique, you may have to write all the styles from scratch or reuse code from previous projects. Imagine that JavaScript, Rust, or Go developers couldn't import packages and they had to implement everything by themselves? Well, that's what happens with CSS.

  **CSS Galore** is the missing code repository for CSS. For now, it is an experimental project, created by [Ã“scar Otero](https://oscarotero.com), and it can be seen as the NPM for CSS.

  ## How it works?

  Due the way CSS works, this is not like the typical package manager where the imported code is stored in a separate directory (say `css_modules`) and cannot be modified but updated using semantic versions. This model is too rigid for CSS, which requires much more flexibility and adaptability and doesn't have a native mechanism to import/export modules. That's why in CSS Galore, the code is added directly to your CSS file and becomes part of your code, so you can edit it to adapt to your needs. This reduce the complexity and prevents the *dependency hell* issue existing in other languages.

  There's an API at [api.css.gal](https:://api.css.gal) generated by the [code registry repository](https://github.com/CSS-Galore/registry). This repository is open for everybody to contribute with Pull requests with more CSS patterns.

  ## Getting started

  For now, there's a [Visual Studio Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oscarotero.css-galore) to search and insert any package of CSS Galore in your code. Just type `_css` to search the package by name and insert it.
